# event-dropdown-form
Take-home test done for the TicketTailor interview process for the Senior UI Developer position

## Form options
- This dropdown form has been implemented with a dummy JSON file named `events.json`
- It has a typeahead function to search events from a large number of items
- Number of selected items is displayed as the `input` placeholder text

## Improvements
- As a user experience, we can introduce a lazy loader or pagination for the scroll dropdown.
