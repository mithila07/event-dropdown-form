Take-home test done for the TicketTailor interview process for the Senior UI Developer position. You can see a working example of a screenshot of the requested code snippet.

## Instructions
- Make sure to have a working internet connection.
- You need to run the `index.html` with a live server (ex., an in-built live server in VS CODE) in order to load events from `events.json` to the dropdown.

## Form options
- This dropdown form has been implemented with a dummy JSON file named `events.json`
- It has a typeahead function to search events from a large number of items
- Number of selected items is displayed as the `input` placeholder text

## Improvements
- For a better user experience, we can introduce a lazy loader or pagination for the scroll dropdown.
